# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Practiced a simple React-Redux App. Its a list of Books, that I want to read in 2017.               

**Thoughts:** The App is still very simple and not very dynamic. But this was a good practice to learn React and Redux and how all of the parts link together and the flow of data.
