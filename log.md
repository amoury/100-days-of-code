# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Practiced a simple React-Redux App. Its a list of Books, that I want to read in 2017.               

**Thoughts:** The App is still very simple and not very dynamic. But this was a good practice to learn React and Redux and how all of the parts link together and the flow of data.

### Day 2: January 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Practiced a React-Redux App that pulls data from Google Books API.               

**Thoughts:** The App is more dynamic than the previous one. This app makes the AJAX calls using axios library to Google Api and makes the list of Books using the user's Search term. Understood the concept of Middleware (Redux-Promise) and the data flow.
